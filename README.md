1) Linear Regression
   Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in Machine Learning and Statistics.
It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a straight line to the data.

The goal is to find the best-fitting line that predicts the target variable as accurately as possible.
